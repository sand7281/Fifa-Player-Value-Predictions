Cleaning our original to get ready for the group presentation on thursday
  * What we need for thursday 
    * Clean up our proposal and make our groups memebers familiar with our variables and what questions we are asking
    * Bootstrap and cross validation for our current models - We need to apply these methods to ever model we currently have and then talk about
      how well the model fits
    * Make sure K-nearest neighbors works in the Group Presentation file has some colors
    * Ridge and/or Lasso Regression for more than just two columns
   
   
   * Challenges: We still have some columns that are not usable data types. We are able to use the columns Age, Overall, Potential, and Wage but nothing else.
      We need to figure out how to control/adjust the colors for our models on certain devices
   * Next steps: Apply decision tree models, Regression tree models, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. We need clean up more columns
      so we can use more than just the 4 currently have
